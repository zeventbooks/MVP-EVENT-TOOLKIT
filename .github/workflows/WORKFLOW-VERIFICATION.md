# Workflow Verification Report

**Date:** 2024-12-07
**Purpose:** Verify no "ghost workflows" are running - only canonical active workflows respond to triggers.

## Active Workflows (3 total)

| Workflow | File | Triggers |
|----------|------|----------|
| **Stage-1 Validation** | `stage1.yml` | PR to main, Push to main, Tag `v*.*.*` |
| **Stage-2 Orchestrator** | `stage2.yml` | workflow_run (Stage-1 success on main) |
| **CodeQL Security Analysis** | `security-scan.yml` | Push to main/claude/**, PR to main, Weekly cron |

## Properly Archived/Disabled Files

### Disabled by Extension
- `unified-ci.yml.disabled` - Will not trigger (invalid extension)

### Archived in Subdirectory
Files in `archive/` are ignored by GitHub Actions (only root `.github/workflows/*.yml` files execute):

| File | Original Purpose |
|------|-----------------|
| `ci-all-gate.yml` | Legacy CI gate |
| `load-testing.yml` | Legacy load testing |
| `qa-rollback.yml` | Legacy QA rollback |
| `quality-gates-scenarios.yml` | Legacy quality gates |
| `stage1-deploy.yml` | Legacy stage1 deploy (superseded) |
| `stage2-staging-contracts.yml` | Legacy staging contracts |
| `stage2-testing.yml` | Legacy stage2 testing |
| `unit-contract-tests.yml` | Legacy unit/contract tests |
| `validate-environment.yml` | Legacy environment validation |

## Expected Behavior Matrix

### Scenario 1: Non-tag Push to main

**Trigger:** `git push origin main` (without tag)

| Workflow | Should Run? | Jobs |
|----------|-------------|------|
| Stage-1 Validation | **YES** | `validate` → `staging-deploy` |
| Stage-2 Orchestrator | **YES** (after Stage-1 succeeds) | `api-smoke`, `ui-smoke`, `validation-gate` |
| CodeQL Security Analysis | **YES** | `analyze` |

### Scenario 2: Pull Request to main

**Trigger:** Open a PR targeting `main`

| Workflow | Should Run? | Jobs |
|----------|-------------|------|
| Stage-1 Validation | **YES** | `validate` only (no deploy) |
| Stage-2 Orchestrator | **NO** | (only triggers on workflow_run) |
| CodeQL Security Analysis | **YES** | `analyze` |

### Scenario 3: Tag Push (vX.Y.Z)

**Trigger:** `git tag v1.0.0 && git push origin v1.0.0`

| Workflow | Should Run? | Jobs |
|----------|-------------|------|
| Stage-1 Validation | **YES** | `validate` → `production-deploy` |
| Stage-2 Orchestrator | **NO** | (only triggers on `branches: [main]`) |
| CodeQL Security Analysis | **NO** | (tags not in trigger) |

## Verification Checklist

### Pre-verification Checks
- [x] Only 3 `.yml` files in `.github/workflows/` root
- [x] All legacy workflows moved to `archive/` subdirectory
- [x] `unified-ci.yml` properly disabled with `.disabled` extension
- [x] `archive/README.md` documents archival policy

### Manual Verification Steps

#### Test 1: Push to main (non-tag)
1. Push a commit to main
2. Go to **Actions** tab
3. Verify only these workflows appear:
   - [ ] Stage-1 Validation (with Validate + Deploy to Staging jobs)
   - [ ] Stage-2 Orchestrator (after Stage-1 succeeds)
   - [ ] CodeQL Security Analysis
4. Verify NO legacy workflows run

#### Test 2: Open PR to main
1. Create a branch and open PR to main
2. Go to **Actions** tab
3. Verify only these workflows appear:
   - [ ] Stage-1 Validation (Validate job only)
   - [ ] CodeQL Security Analysis
4. Verify Stage-2 does NOT run

#### Test 3: Create tag vX.Y.Z
1. Create and push a semantic version tag
2. Go to **Actions** tab
3. Verify only these workflows appear:
   - [ ] Stage-1 Validation (with Validate + Deploy to Production + Smoke Tests)
4. Verify Stage-2 does NOT run on tags
5. Verify no legacy workflows run

## Acceptance Criteria

| Criterion | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| No archived workflows show in Actions UI when triggers hit | **EXPECTED PASS** |
| Only stage1/stage2/security respond to relevant events | **EXPECTED PASS** |
| No duplicate/conflicting workflow names | **VERIFIED** |
| All legacy workflows properly archived | **VERIFIED** |

## Conclusion

Based on static analysis of the workflow files:

1. **File structure is correct** - Only 3 active workflow files in root, all legacy files in `archive/` subdirectory
2. **Trigger configuration is correct** - Each workflow responds only to its designated events
3. **No ghost workflows possible** - GitHub Actions only executes `.yml`/`.yaml` files in the root of `.github/workflows/`

**Recommendation:** Complete manual verification by running the 3 test scenarios above and confirming expected behavior in the GitHub Actions UI.
