## ✅ Pre-Deployment Checklist

### One-Time Setup (Do Once)

- [ ] **Google Cloud Project configured**
  - [ ] Project: `zeventbooks` exists and is accessible
  - [ ] Apps Script API enabled in GCP Console
  - [ ] Service account `apps-script-deployer` created
  - [ ] Service account key downloaded (JSON)

- [ ] **Apps Script API - User Settings (CRITICAL!)**
  - [ ] Visit: https://script.google.com/home/usersettings
  - [ ] Toggle ON: "Google Apps Script API"
  - [ ] Verify: ✅ "Google Apps Script API: ON"
  - [ ] **⚠️ This must be done by the PROJECT OWNER**

- [ ] Branch is up to date with main
- [ ] No sensitive data in code (secrets, API keys)

## 🚀 Deployment Methods

### Method 1: Automated CI/CD (Recommended)

```bash
# Push to main branch triggers automatic deployment
git push origin main
```

**What happens:**
1. ✅ Lint code
2. ✅ Run unit tests (94 tests)
3. ✅ Run contract tests
4. ✅ Deploy to Apps Script via API
5. ✅ Run E2E tests on deployed URL
6. ✅ Upload test reports

**Monitor:** https://github.com/zeventbooks/MVP-EVENT-TOOLKIT/actions

### Method 2: Manual Deployment via API (Local)

```bash
# Set environment variables
export SCRIPT_ID='1YO4apLOQoAIh208AcAqWO3pWtx_O3yas_QC4z-pkurgMem9UgYOsp86l'
export SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON='<paste service account JSON here>'

# Run deployment
npm run deploy
```

### Method 3: Clasp (Backup/Emergency)

```bash
# Login (first time only)
clasp login

# Push code
clasp push --force

# Deploy
clasp deploy --description "Emergency deploy $(date)"

# Get URL
clasp deployments
```

---

## 🔍 Diagnostic Commands

### Test Service Account Access

```bash
# Run comprehensive diagnostics
export SCRIPT_ID='1YO4apLOQoAIh208AcAqWO3pWtx_O3yas_QC4z-pkurgMem9UgYOsp86l'
export SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON='<paste service account JSON here>'

npm run deploy:diagnose
```

**Checks:**
1. ✅ Environment variables are set
2. ✅ Service account authentication works
3. ✅ Apps Script API is enabled (project level)
4. ✅ Service account has access to the script
5. ✅ Apps Script API user setting is enabled (CRITICAL!)

### Test Production URL

```bash
# Health check
curl "https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycbx6ZTFD8H3NiAlagCLHa9DPzhgxcqWRmGXGiXzzC8CTpRUBUY_YHhfKDzGCdgMkKMZNMA/exec?page=status"

# Admin page (requires ADMIN_KEY)
curl "https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycbx6ZTFD8H3NiAlagCLHa9DPzhgxcqWRmGXGiXzzC8CTpRUBUY_YHhfKDzGCdgMkKMZNMA/exec?page=admin&tenant=root&key=YOUR_ADMIN_KEY"
```

## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: "User has not enabled the Apps Script API"

**Symptom:** Deployment fails with 403 error

**Root Cause:** Apps Script API not enabled in user settings (Step 1.4 in setup)

**Solution:**
1. **Project owner** must visit: https://script.google.com/home/usersettings
2. Toggle ON: "Google Apps Script API"
3. Wait 2-5 minutes
4. Retry deployment

**Prevention:**
- ✅ Verify user setting is ON before any deployment
- ✅ Document who the project owner is
- ✅ If project owner changes, new owner must enable this setting

### Issue 2: "Service account does not have permission"

**Symptom:** Cannot read/write to Apps Script project

**Root Cause:** Service account not added to Apps Script project sharing

**Solution:**
1. Go to: https://script.google.com/home/projects/1YO4apLOQoAIh208AcAqWO3pWtx_O3yas_QC4z-pkurgMem9UgYOsp86l/edit
2. Click "Share"
3. Add: `apps-script-deployer@zeventbooks.iam.gserviceaccount.com` as **Editor**

**Prevention:**
- ✅ Keep service account in shared list
- ✅ Don't remove service account access
- ✅ If project is duplicated, re-share with service account

### Issue 3: GitHub Actions deployment fails

**Symptom:** CI/CD pipeline fails at deploy step

**Root Cause:** Missing or invalid GitHub secrets

**Solution:**
1. Check secrets: https://github.com/zeventbooks/MVP-EVENT-TOOLKIT/settings/secrets/actions
2. Verify `APPS_SCRIPT_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON` exists and is valid JSON
3. Verify `SCRIPT_ID` matches: `1YO4apLOQoAIh208AcAqWO3pWtx_O3yas_QC4z-pkurgMem9UgYOsp86l`

**Prevention:**
- ✅ Test locally with `npm run deploy:diagnose` before pushing
- ✅ Keep service account key backed up securely (NOT in git)
- ✅ Rotate keys annually and update GitHub secret

### Issue 4: Deployment succeeds but URL returns 404

**Symptom:** Deployment completes but web app doesn't load

**Root Cause:** Deployment not set to "Execute as: Me" or "Who has access: Anyone"

**Solution:**
1. Go to: https://script.google.com/home/projects/1YO4apLOQoAIh208AcAqWO3pWtx_O3yas_QC4z-pkurgMem9UgYOsp86l/deployments
2. Click on active deployment
3. Verify settings:
   - Execute as: **Me** (project owner)
   - Who has access: **Anyone**

**Prevention:**
- ✅ Check deployment settings after first deployment
- ✅ Document correct settings in this file

## 📊 Monitoring & Maintenance

### Daily Checks
- [ ] Production URL responds: `curl <URL>?page=status`
- [ ] No errors in Apps Script logs

### Weekly Checks
- [ ] Run full test suite: `npm run test:all`
- [ ] Check GitHub Actions success rate
- [ ] Review error logs

### Monthly Checks
- [ ] Verify all GitHub secrets are still valid
- [ ] Test backup deployment method (Clasp)
- [ ] Review and update this document

### Quarterly Checks
- [ ] Rotate service account keys (security best practice)
- [ ] Audit service account permissions
- [ ] Review and test disaster recovery procedures

## 🔄 Rollback Procedures

### If bad deployment goes live:

**Option 1: Revert via GitHub**
```bash
# Revert the commit
git revert <bad-commit-sha>
git push origin main

# CI/CD will auto-deploy the reverted code
```

**Option 2: Redeploy previous version via Clasp**
```bash
# List deployments
clasp deployments

# Undeploy current
clasp undeploy <deployment-id>

# Redeploy previous version from Apps Script UI
# Go to: Deploy → Manage deployments → Click previous version
```

**Option 3: Manual rollback in Apps Script UI**
1. Go to: https://script.google.com/home/projects/1YO4apLOQoAIh208AcAqWO3pWtx_O3yas_QC4z-pkurgMem9UgYOsp86l/deployments
2. Find working version
3. Click "⋮" → "Test deployments"
4. Promote to production
