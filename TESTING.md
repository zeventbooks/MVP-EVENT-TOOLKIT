# Testing Guide

Complete guide to running tests for MVP Event Toolkit.

## Test Structure

```
tests/
├── unit/           → Jest (backend logic)
├── contract/       → Jest (API validation)
├── smoke/          → Playwright (quick health checks)
└── e2e/            → Playwright (full user flows)
```

**Important:** Jest and Playwright tests are separated to avoid conflicts.

---

## Quick Start

### Run All Tests

```bash
# Run Jest tests (unit + contract) then Playwright tests (smoke + e2e)
npm run test:all
```

### Run Jest Tests Only

```bash
# All Jest tests with coverage
npm test

# With coverage report
npm run test:coverage

# Unit tests only
npm run test:unit

# Contract tests only
npm run test:contract

# Watch mode (re-run on file changes)
npm run test:watch
```

### Run Playwright Tests Only

```bash
# All Playwright tests (smoke + e2e)
npm run test:playwright

# Smoke tests only (quick, ~1 min)
npm run test:smoke

# E2E tests only (requires BASE_URL)
npm run test:e2e
```

## Test Types Explained

### 1. Unit Tests (Jest)

**Location:** `tests/unit/backend.test.js`
**Count:** 78 tests
**Duration:** ~5 seconds

**What they test:**
- Backend utility functions
- Input sanitization (XSS prevention)
- Error envelope creation (Ok/Err)
- URL validation
- Schema validation
- Rate limiting logic
- Slug generation

**Run:**
```bash
npm run test:unit
```

**Example output:**
```
PASS tests/unit/backend.test.js
  ✓ should create success response with value (3ms)
  ✓ should remove XSS characters
  ✓ should validate URLs correctly

Tests: 78 passed, 78 total
Time: 1.167s
```

### 4. E2E Tests (Playwright)

**Location:** `tests/e2e/critical-flows.spec.js`

export ADMIN_KEY="your-admin-secret"

# Run E2E tests
npm run test:e2e

# Run in headed mode
npm run test:e2e -- --headed

# Debug mode (step through)
npx playwright test --debug tests/e2e/critical-flows.spec.js
```

---

## Environment Variables

### Required for Playwright Tests

```bash
# Deployed Apps Script URL
export BASE_URL="https://script.google.com/macros/s/YOUR_DEPLOYMENT_ID/exec"

# Admin secret for testing (optional for smoke, required for E2E)
export ADMIN_KEY="CHANGE_ME_root"

# Tenant ID (defaults to 'root')
export TENANT_ID="root"
```

### Setting Permanently (Optional)

Create `.env` file in project root:
```bash
BASE_URL=https://script.google.com/macros/s/.../exec
ADMIN_KEY=CHANGE_ME_root
TENANT_ID=root
```

Then load in terminal:
```bash
source .env
```

## Playwright Options

### Browsers

```bash
# Run on specific browser
npm run test:smoke -- --project=chromium
npm run test:smoke -- --project="Mobile Chrome"
npm run test:smoke -- --project="TV Display"
```

### Headed Mode (See Browser)

```bash
npm run test:smoke -- --headed
```

### Debug Mode (Step Through)

```bash
npx playwright test --debug
```

### UI Mode (Interactive)

```bash
npx playwright test --ui
```

### Specific Test

```bash
npx playwright test tests/smoke/pages.smoke.test.js
```

### Parallel Execution

```bash
# Run tests in parallel (default in CI)
npm run test:smoke -- --workers=4

# Run tests serially (useful for debugging)
npm run test:smoke -- --workers=1
```

---

## CI/CD Pipeline

GitHub Actions runs tests automatically:

```
Lint → Unit → Contract → Deploy → Smoke → E2E
  ↓      ↓       ↓          ↓       ↓       ↓
 10s    5s      3s        30s     1min    3min
```

**Triggers:**
- Push to `main` → Full pipeline + deployment
- Push to `claude/**` → Tests only (no deploy)
- Pull requests → Tests only

**Configuration:** `.github/workflows/ci.yml`

---

## Coverage Reports

```bash
# Generate coverage report
npm run test:coverage

# View HTML report
open coverage/lcov-report/index.html
```

**Coverage targets:**
- Statements: 60%
- Branches: 50%
- Functions: 60%
- Lines: 60%

---

## Troubleshooting

### Jest tries to run Playwright tests

**Error:**
```
Playwright Test needs to be invoked via 'npx playwright test'
```

**Solution:** Jest config has been updated to exclude Playwright tests. Make sure you're using:
```bash
npm test              # Jest only
npm run test:smoke    # Playwright only
```

### Playwright tests timeout

**Error:**
```
Test timeout of 30000ms exceeded
```

**Solutions:**
1. Check BASE_URL is correct
2. Verify deployment is live
3. Increase timeout:
   ```bash
   npm run test:smoke -- --timeout=60000
   ```

### BASE_URL not set

**Error:**
```
Cannot read property 'goto' of undefined
```

**Solution:**
```bash
export BASE_URL="https://script.google.com/macros/s/.../exec"
```

### Tests fail in CI but pass locally

**Common causes:**
1. Environment variables not set in GitHub Secrets
2. Deployment not complete before tests run
3. Rate limiting (too many requests)

**Solution:**
Check GitHub Actions secrets are set:
- `SCRIPT_ID`
- `CLASPRC_JSON`
- `ADMIN_KEY_ROOT`

## Best Practices

### Before Committing

```bash
# 1. Lint code
npm run lint

# 2. Run Jest tests
npm test

# 3. Format code
npm run format
```

### Before Merging to Main

```bash
# 1. Run all Jest tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# 2. Deploy to test environment
npm run push && npm run deploy

# 3. Run smoke tests on deployed URL
export BASE_URL="your-test-url"
npm run test:smoke

# 4. Run full E2E suite
npm run test:e2e
```

### In Production

```bash
# Run smoke tests against production
export BASE_URL="https://script.google.com/macros/s/.../exec"
npm run test:smoke

# Monitor for failures
# Set up alerts if tests fail
```
