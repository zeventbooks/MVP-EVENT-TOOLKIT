## User-Friendly Subpage Naming Guidelines

### ✅ DO Use These Words:
- **my-events** (not "event-list")
- **scoreboard** (not "scores-view")
- **schedule** (not "game-times")
- **standings** (not "rankings-table")
- **thank-you** (not "confirmation")
- **player-info** (not "user-details")
- **team-selection** (not "pick-team")
- **download** (not "export-pdf")
- **share** (not "social-share")

### ❌ AVOID Technical Terms:
- ~~settings~~ → Use "preferences" or "account"
- ~~config~~ → Use "setup"
- ~~api~~ → Use specific feature names
- ~~webhook~~ → Don't expose to users
- ~~callback~~ → Don't expose to users

### 🎯 Use Action Words:
- **create-event** (clear action)
- **edit-team** (clear action)
- **view-results** (clear action)
- **download-poster** (clear action)

## Mobile-Friendly Short URLs

For texting/social media, use shorter versions:

```
# Instead of:
https://zeventbooks.com/fall-league-2024-signup/player-info

# Use shortlink (if configured):
https://zeventbooks.com/r?t=abc123

# Or shorter event slugs:
https://zeventbooks.com/fl24-signup
https://zeventbooks.com/fl24-display/scores
```

---

## SEO-Friendly URLs

Use descriptive event slugs with location/date:

```
# Good (descriptive):
https://zeventbooks.com/chicago-fall-bocce-league-2024
https://zeventbooks.com/lincoln-park-tournament-june-2024

# Avoid (too generic):
https://zeventbooks.com/event-123
https://zeventbooks.com/e1
```

---

## Testing URLs (Before Going Live)

Enable debug mode to test routing:

1. Edit `index.php` on Hostinger
2. Set `$debugMode = true;` (line 23)
3. Visit any URL to see routing details
4. Set back to `false` when done

**Debug mode shows:**
- What route matched
- Event slug extracted
- Subpage detected
- Final target URL
