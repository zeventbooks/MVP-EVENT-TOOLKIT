# E2E Test Organization

This directory contains comprehensive end-to-end tests organized by test level and purpose.

## Test Hierarchy

Tests are organized in **three levels** that run sequentially:

### 1. 🚨 Smoke Tests (Level 1)
**Location:** `tests/e2e/1-smoke/`
**Run Time:** < 30 seconds
**Purpose:** Quick health checks to verify system is alive

**What they test:**
- Critical API endpoints respond (200 status)
- Health check passes
- Basic page loads (Admin, Public, Display)
- No JavaScript errors on load
- Performance baselines (< 2s API, < 5s page load)

**When to run:**
- Every deployment
- Every commit to main
- Before running other test suites
- As a pre-check before manual testing

**Run command:**
```bash
npm run test:smoke
```

---

### 2. 📄 Page Tests (Level 2)
**Location:** `tests/e2e/2-pages/`
**Run Time:** 2-5 minutes
**Purpose:** Test all page components and interactions

**What they test:**
- **Admin Page** (`admin-page.spec.js`)
  - All form inputs render and accept data
  - Submit button works
  - Configure Display & Sponsors button
  - Add/Remove Sponsor buttons
  - Save Configuration button
  - Navigation links work
  - Form validation
  - Responsive design
  - Keyboard accessibility

**Run command:**
```bash
npm run test:pages
```

---

### 3. 🔄 Flow Tests (Level 3)
**Location:** `tests/e2e/3-flows/`
**Run Time:** 5-15 minutes
**Purpose:** Test complete end-to-end user journeys

**What they test:**

- **Admin Flows** (`admin-flows.spec.js`)
  - Complete event creation → publish workflow
  - Event creation → verification on public page
  - Configure sponsors → verify on display
  - Add multiple sponsors → reorder → save
  - Multi-event management

  - Error handling (invalid admin key, missing fields)
  - Bulk operations

- **Customer Flows** (`customer-flows.spec.js`)
  - Event discovery (land → browse → view details)
  - Search events → filter → view results
  - Browse by date → calendar view
  - View event → read details → click sponsor
  - Share event on social media
  - Add event to calendar → download ICS
  - Mobile user experience (portrait, landscape)
  - Accessibility journey (keyboard-only, screen reader)
  - Performance journey (slow connection)
  - Returning visitor experience

- **Sponsor Flows** (`sponsor-flows.spec.js`)
  - Configure sponsors → view on TV display → verify visibility
  - Multiple sponsor tiers → display order → rotation
  - Click tracking and analytics
  - Carousel auto-rotation and manual controls
  - Mobile banner display
  - Multi-position display (top, bottom, left, right, mobile)
  - Performance and loading (many sponsors, lazy loading)

**When to run:**
- After page tests pass
- Before major releases
- Weekly comprehensive testing
- After significant feature changes

**Run command:**
```bash
npm run test:flows
```

## Running Tests

### Sequential (Recommended for CI/CD)
Runs tests in order: smoke → pages → flows
```bash
npm run test:e2e
```

### Parallel (Faster, but less organized)
Runs all E2E tests simultaneously
```bash
npm run test:e2e:parallel
```

### Individual Test Levels
```bash
npm run test:smoke    # Smoke tests only (~30s)
npm run test:pages    # Page tests only (~2-5min)
npm run test:flows    # Flow tests only (~5-15min)
```

### Quick Validation
Run Jest unit tests + smoke tests for rapid feedback
```bash
npm run test:quick
```

### Full Test Suite
Run everything: unit, contract, smoke, pages, flows
```bash
npm run test:all
```

---

## Test Organization Benefits

### 1. **Fast Feedback Loop**
- Smoke tests fail fast (30s) if something is critically broken
- No need to run 15-minute flow tests if basic health checks fail

### 2. **Clear Test Reports**
- CI/CD shows three distinct test stages
- Easy to identify which level failed: smoke, page, or flow
- Test.html dashboard groups tests visually

### 3. **Efficient Debugging**
- If smoke tests pass but page tests fail → UI component issue
- If page tests pass but flow tests fail → integration/logic issue
- Clear separation reduces debugging time

### 4. **Parallel Development**
- Different teams can work on different test levels
- Frontend devs focus on page tests
- QA engineers focus on flow tests
- DevOps focus on smoke tests

### 5. **Performance Tracking**
- Track performance trends by test level
- Smoke tests measure API/page load performance
- Flow tests measure end-to-end transaction time

## Test Reporting

### Test.html Dashboard
Access the visual test dashboard at:
```
https://your-deployment-url.com?page=test&brand=root
```

The dashboard shows:
- Test summary cards (smoke, pages, flows, passed, failed)
- Collapsible test groups with color coding
- Individual test results with timing
- Auto-runs tests on page load
- Manual "Run All Tests" button

### CI/CD Reports
After each deployment, GitHub Actions generates:
- `smoke-test-report/` - Smoke test HTML report
- `page-test-report/` - Page test HTML report
- `flow-test-report/` - Flow test HTML report

Download from GitHub Actions artifacts.

## Adding New Tests

### Adding a Smoke Test
```javascript
// tests/e2e/1-smoke/critical-smoke.spec.js
test('New critical check', async ({ page }) => {
  // Quick health check (< 5 seconds)
});
```

### Adding a Page Test
```javascript
// tests/e2e/2-pages/your-page.spec.js
test.describe('📄 PAGE: YourPage - Button Tests', () => {
  test('Button X is clickable', async ({ page }) => {
    // Test button interaction
  });
});
```

### Adding a Flow Test
```javascript
// tests/e2e/3-flows/your-flow.spec.js
test.describe('🔄 FLOW: Your User Journey', () => {
  test('Complete flow: Step 1 → Step 2 → Step 3', async ({ page }) => {
    // Test complete user journey
  });
});
```

- ❌ No full user journeys
- ❌ No extensive data validation

### Page Tests ✅
- ✅ Test all buttons and forms
- ✅ Verify UI components render
- ✅ Check responsive design
- ✅ Test keyboard navigation
- ❌ No complex workflows
- ❌ No multi-page journeys

### Flow Tests ✅
- ✅ Test complete user journeys
- ✅ Verify end-to-end functionality
- ✅ Test edge cases and error handling
- ✅ Simulate real user behavior
- ❌ No micro-level UI testing (use page tests)
- ❌ No basic health checks (use smoke tests)

## Environment Variables

Required for E2E tests:
```bash
BASE_URL=https://your-deployment-url.com    # Apps Script web app URL
ADMIN_KEY=your_admin_key_here               # Admin authentication key
TENANT_ID=root                               # Default tenant (optional)
```

Set in CI/CD:
- GitHub Secrets: `ADMIN_KEY_ROOT`
- Deployment output: `BASE_URL` (from clasp deploy)

---

## Troubleshooting

### Tests fail locally but pass in CI
- Check `BASE_URL` environment variable
- Ensure local deployment is up-to-date
- Verify admin key is correct

### Smoke tests pass, but page tests fail
- UI component issue
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify selectors match actual HTML

### Page tests pass, but flow tests fail
- Integration issue between components
- Check API responses
- Verify data persistence

### All tests timeout
- Check `BASE_URL` is accessible
- Verify Apps Script deployment is live
- Check network connectivity

## Test Metrics

Track these metrics over time:
- **Smoke Test Duration:** Should stay under 30s
- **Page Test Duration:** Should stay under 5min
