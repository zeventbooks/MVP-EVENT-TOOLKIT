## Quick Reference

**External uptime / SLO is measured via `?p=status`.**

### Health Check URLs

| Check | URL | Expected Response |
|-------|-----|-------------------|
| Ping | `https://www.eventangle.com/ping` | `{"status":"ok"}` |
| Status (SLO anchor) | `https://www.eventangle.com/status` | `{"ok":true,"db":{"ok":true},...}` |
| Setup | `https://www.eventangle.com/status?p=setup` | 6-point diagnostic |

### Data Health Sheets

| Sheet | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `DATA_ISSUES` | Issues found by nightly health checker - **check this first if system is acting weird** |
| `DIAG` | Diagnostic logs |
| `LOG_ERRORS` | API error logs |

### Quick Commands

```bash
# Basic health check
curl -s https://www.eventangle.com/ping

## Incident Response

### When Alerted

**Step 1: Acknowledge** (0-2 minutes)
- Mark alert as acknowledged in monitoring tool
- Note the time and initial symptoms

**Step 2: Verify** (2-5 minutes)
```bash
# Try the ping endpoint
curl -s -w "\nHTTP Status: %{http_code}\nTime: %{time_total}s\n" \
  https://www.eventangle.com/ping

# If that fails, try direct GAS URL (bypasses Cloudflare)
curl -s -w "\nHTTP Status: %{http_code}\n" \
  "https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycbyS1cW9VhviR-Jr8AmYY_BAGrb1gzuKkrgEBP2M3bMdqAv4ktqHOZInWV8ogkpz5i8SYQ/exec?p=ping"
```

**Step 3: Diagnose** (5-15 minutes)
- See specific issue sections below

**Step 4: Resolve or Escalate** (15+ minutes)
- Apply fix from runbook
- Or escalate to development team

## Common Issues

### Issue: Ping Returns Non-200

**Symptoms:**
- Uptime monitor alerts "DOWN"
- `curl` returns HTTP 5xx or no response

**Diagnostic Steps:**

1. **Check Cloudflare status**
   - Visit https://www.cloudflarestatus.com/
   - Look for incidents affecting Workers

2. **Check Google Apps Script status**
   - Visit https://www.google.com/appsstatus
   - Look for Apps Script service issues

3. **Test direct GAS URL** (bypasses Cloudflare):
   ```bash
   curl -s "https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycbyS1cW9VhviR-Jr8AmYY_BAGrb1gzuKkrgEBP2M3bMdqAv4ktqHOZInWV8ogkpz5i8SYQ/exec?p=ping"
   ```

4. **Check Cloudflare Worker logs**:
   - Log in to Cloudflare Dashboard
   - Go to Workers > eventangle-events
   - Check "Logs" tab for errors

**Resolution:**
- If GAS is down: Wait for Google to restore service
- If Cloudflare is down: Wait for Cloudflare to restore service
- If both are up but site is down: Check recent deployments

---

### Issue: Ping Returns 200 but Wrong Content

**Symptoms:**
- HTTP 200 but body doesn't contain "ok"
- Keyword check fails in monitoring

**Diagnostic Steps:**

1. **Check full response**:
   ```bash
   curl -s https://www.eventangle.com/ping | cat -v
   ```

2. **Check status endpoint for details**:
   ```bash
   curl -s https://www.eventangle.com/status | jq
   ```

3. **Run full setup diagnostics**:
   ```bash
   curl -s "https://www.eventangle.com/status?p=setup&brand=root" | jq '.value.checks'
   ```

**Resolution:**
- Review the `issues` and `fixes` arrays in the setup response
- Follow the suggested fix steps

---

### Issue: Slow Response Times

**Symptoms:**
- Response times > 5 seconds
- Intermittent timeouts

**Diagnostic Steps:**

1. **Measure response time**:
   ```bash
   curl -s -w "Total time: %{time_total}s\n" -o /dev/null \
     https://www.eventangle.com/ping
   ```

2. **Compare GAS vs Cloudflare**:
   ```bash
   # Direct GAS (no proxy)
   curl -s -w "GAS Direct: %{time_total}s\n" -o /dev/null \
     "https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycbyS1cW9VhviR-Jr8AmYY_BAGrb1gzuKkrgEBP2M3bMdqAv4ktqHOZInWV8ogkpz5i8SYQ/exec?p=ping"

   # Via Cloudflare
   curl -s -w "Cloudflare: %{time_total}s\n" -o /dev/null \
     https://www.eventangle.com/ping
   ```

3. **Check for cold start** (GAS apps sleep after inactivity):
   - First request after inactivity may take 5-10 seconds
   - Subsequent requests should be < 2 seconds

**Resolution:**
- If only first request is slow: This is normal GAS cold start behavior
- If consistently slow: Check Google Apps Script quotas and status

---

### Issue: Spreadsheet Access Errors

**Symptoms:**
- Status shows `"ok": false`
- Error message mentions spreadsheet access

**Diagnostic Steps:**

1. **Run setup diagnostics**:
   ```bash
   curl -s "https://www.eventangle.com/status?p=setup&brand=root" | jq '.value.checks[] | select(.name == "Spreadsheet Access")'
   ```

2. **Check for quota issues**:
   - Google Sheets has read/write quotas
   - High traffic can exhaust quotas

**Resolution:**
- Verify spreadsheet still exists and hasn't been deleted
- Verify script owner still has access
- Check Google Workspace admin console for quota status
- See [SETUP_DIAGNOSTICS.md](./SETUP_DIAGNOSTICS.md) for detailed fix steps

---

### Issue: Recent Deployment Broke Something

**Symptoms:**
- Issues started after a deployment
- New build ID in status response

**Diagnostic Steps:**

1. **Check current build**:
   ```bash
   curl -s https://www.eventangle.com/status | jq '.buildId'
   ```

2. **Check GitHub Actions history**:
   - Go to repository > Actions tab
   - Review recent workflow runs
   - Look for failed tests or deployment errors

3. **Check what changed**:
   - Review commits in the last deployment
   - Look for changes to routing, Config.gs, or Code.gs

**Resolution:**
- If deployment is broken: Revert to previous Apps Script version
  1. Open Apps Script editor
  2. Go to Deploy > Manage deployments
  3. Edit the web app deployment
  4. Select a previous version
  5. Update Cloudflare Worker with old deployment ID if needed

---

### Issue: Brand-Specific Failures

**Symptoms:**
- One brand returns errors, others work fine
- Error mentions brand configuration

**Diagnostic Steps:**

1. **Test specific brand**:
   ```bash
   curl -s "https://www.eventangle.com/status?p=status&brand=abc" | jq
   curl -s "https://www.eventangle.com/status?p=setup&brand=abc" | jq
   ```

2. **Compare with working brand**:
   ```bash
   curl -s "https://www.eventangle.com/status?p=setup&brand=root" | jq
   ```

**Resolution:**
- Check brand configuration in Config.gs
- Verify brand's spreadsheet ID is valid
- Check brand's admin secret is set in Script Properties

   - Mark incident as resolved
   - Add brief description

2. **Document in incident log**
   - Time detected
   - Time resolved
   - Root cause
   - Fix applied
   - Lessons learned

3. **Create follow-up tasks**
   - Improve monitoring if detection was slow
   - Add automation if manual steps were needed
   - Update this runbook if procedures were unclear

---

## Preventive Measures

### Daily
- Check uptime dashboard for any yellow/red indicators
- Review response time trends

### Weekly
- Review GitHub Actions for any test failures
- Check Google Sheets quotas if traffic increased

### After Each Deployment
- Verify ping endpoint returns 200
- Run setup diagnostics
- Monitor for 15 minutes for errors

## Data Health Checker

### Overview

The Data Health Checker (`DataHealthChecker.gs`) provides nightly sanity checking for EVENTS and DIAG sheets. It detects data corruption, missing fields, and impossible states before they cause live event issues.

**If the system is acting weird, check the DATA_ISSUES sheet first!**

### Quick Commands

```javascript
// Run manual health check
checkDataHealth_()

// Check specific brand
checkBrandDataHealth_('abc')

// Run with email notification
checkDataHealthWithEmail_('ops@example.com')

// Get quick summary (no write)
getDataHealthSummary_()
```

### Automatic Nightly Checks

The health checker runs automatically every night at 3 AM (after DIAG archiving at 2 AM).

**Install/Manage Trigger:**
```javascript
// Install nightly trigger
installDataHealthTrigger_()

// List active triggers
listDataHealthTriggers_()

// Remove trigger
uninstallDataHealthTrigger_()
```

### What Gets Checked

| Check | Severity | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| EVENTS required fields | ERROR | id, slug, brandId, templateId, dataJSON, createdAt |
| EVENTS contract fields | ERROR | name, startDateISO, venue, links.*, ctas.primary.* |
| EVENTS settings fields | WARN | settings.showSchedule, showStandings, showBracket |
| EVENTS metadata | WARN | createdAtISO, updatedAtISO |
| DIAG required fields | ERROR | ts, level, where, msg |
| DIAG valid levels | WARN | Must be: info, warn, error, debug |
| Orphan event references | WARN | DIAG/ANALYTICS rows referencing non-existent events |

### DATA_ISSUES Sheet

Issues are written to the `DATA_ISSUES` sheet with these columns:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| timestamp | When the check was run |
| severity | error, warn, or info |
| category | Issue type (e.g., EVENTS_MISSING_FIELD) |
| sheet | Source sheet (EVENTS, DIAG, ANALYTICS) |
| rowNumber | Row number with the issue |
| field | Field name with the issue |
| message | Human-readable description |
| value | Problematic value (if applicable) |

**Severity colors:**
- Red background = ERROR (needs immediate attention)
- Yellow background = WARNING (should investigate)
- Blue background = INFO (informational only)

### Issue: DATA_ISSUES Sheet Has Errors

**Symptoms:**
- DATA_ISSUES sheet has red (error) rows
- Nightly email notification received

**Diagnostic Steps:**

1. **Open DATA_ISSUES sheet** in the spreadsheet

2. **Filter by severity = error** to see critical issues

3. **Navigate to problem rows** using the rowNumber column

4. **Fix the data** directly in the source sheet (EVENTS or DIAG)

5. **Re-run health check** to verify:
   ```javascript
   checkDataHealth_()
   ```

**Common Issues and Fixes:**

| Issue | Cause | Fix |
|-------|-------|-----|
| Missing id | Row corruption | Delete row or restore from backup |
| Invalid dataJSON | Malformed JSON | Fix JSON syntax in cell |
| Missing startDateISO | Incomplete event | Edit event and add date |
| Missing links.publicUrl | Event not properly saved | Re-save event via Admin |
| Orphan event reference | Event was deleted | Ignore (historical data) or archive DIAG |

### Issue: Health Check Failing

**Symptoms:**
- Health check returns errors
- Cannot access spreadsheet

**Diagnostic Steps:**

1. **Check spreadsheet access:**
   ```javascript
   getDataHealthSummary_()
   ```

2. **Verify spreadsheet exists** and script has access

3. **Check for quota issues** - health check reads many rows

4. **Run with specific spreadsheet ID:**
   ```javascript
   checkDataHealth_({ spreadsheetId: '1abc...' })
   ```

### Environment Selection

Health check supports staging vs production via spreadsheet ID:

```javascript
// Production (default - uses root brand config)
checkDataHealth_()

// Staging (specific spreadsheet)
checkDataHealth_({ spreadsheetId: 'STAGING_SPREADSHEET_ID' })

// Specific brand
checkDataHealth_({ brandId: 'abc' })
```
